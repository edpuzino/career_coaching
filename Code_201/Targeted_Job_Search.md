# Targeted Job Search

Read [this article][1] on how to target companies and get hired. 

After doing some research, submit a Google Sheet [(using this template)][2] listing your top 5 to 10 targeted companies with backlink to their website. This list should be comprised of different sized companies, not just big box corporations. 

Submit a URL to your g.sheet and allow "comment" access.
